### What Is It?

The USPSA classification system dates back to 1985 when then President Dave Stanford proposed a system of classifying a large number of competitors from a common database. Members shoot [USPSA Classifier Stages](https://uspsa.org/classifiers) at matches and the scores are submitted to USPSA and added to the member profiles.

### Hit Factors and Maximum Hit Factors

Members are awarded a class based on a series of percentages that are calculated for them. Each percentage is the score (hit factor) they shoot on a specific stage divided by the maximum hit factor used for that stage. The maximum hit factors are derived from the scores of the top shooters.

### Classification Bracket Percentages

| Classification | Percentage of Maximum Hit Factor |
|:--------------:|:-------------------------------:|
| Grand Master   | 95 to 100%                      |
| Master         | 85 to 94.9%                     |
| A              | 75 to 84.9%                     |
| B              | 60 to 74.9%                     |
| C              | 40 to 59.9%                     |
| D              | 2 to 40%                        |

### Earning A Classification

To become classified, a member must have at least four valid scores from different classifier courses in the USPSA database. If more than four scores are in the database when the averages are calculated, the best four of the most recent six valid scores will be used.

It is important to note that for **initial classifications**, all scores greater than 2 percent will be used. Scores flagged B or C may not be considered valid, so lower scores could still be included.

Clubs are responsible for administering classifier stages properly and submitting the scores. If classifiers are repeated in a match, the first score must be used for match standings. The reshoot must be entered as a second entry. For details, see the [Practiscore Training Video, Part 9](https://uspsa.org/practiscore/).

Competitors may only reshoot the stage once per division per match ([Feb. 28, 2017 USPSA BOD minutes](https://uspsa.org/bod_minutes)).

Each Tuesday night, USPSA evaluates new scores. During national championships, this may be delayed.

A member's classification in a division cannot be more than one class lower than their highest classification in any other division.

### Reclassification

Reclassifications are based on the best six of the most recent eight valid scores. If only five scores are on record, all five are averaged.

If a member's average rises into a higher bracket, they are reclassified upward. The same process applies for requesting to move down.

### Requesting a Lower Classification

Members who believe their current classification no longer reflects their ability (due to age, injury, etc.) can submit a formal request via the [USPSA Reclassification form](https://uspsa.org/reclassification).

The Classification Review Team will assess performance over 1–2 years. Classification changes are made based on data — not personal circumstance.

Even if your average is lower than your class, you **must** request a downgrade.

### The Revolving Window

The system uses the **most recent eight valid scores**, sorted by match date and percentage. Older scores are bumped out unless submitted too late.

Scores are flagged as valid or invalid based on specific rules, which can affect how your classification is calculated.

### The Flagging System

| Flag Code | Flag Meaning |
|:---------:|:-------------|
| A | Not used. More than 20% above class; considered invalid unless appealed. [Appeal form](https://uspsa.org/flags) |
| B | More than 5% below minimum score for class or less than 2%; not used. Applied during match upload. |
| C | More than one class below member's highest classification. Exceptions apply for new divisions. |
| D | Lower score from multiple classifier attempts in same match. |
| E | Not in most recent 8 scores. Removed over time. |
| F | Two lowest scores considered in classification. |
| G | Score less than 2%; not used. |
| I | Admin-excluded scores (e.g., expired memberships, wrong member number). |
| X | Score submitted with expired membership (>60 days). |
| Y | Used to calculate current average. May be changed based on future scores. |
| No flag | Score not yet evaluated (newly entered). |

### Your Scores On The Web Page

Log in to the USPSA site to view your profile, classifier scores, and match history.

If a score is missing, the club might not have submitted the match or entered your member number correctly. Check the match results page to verify, then contact your club’s stat person if needed.

### Scores From Major Matches

Level II and III matches may also count for classification if these conditions are met:

- Division has at least **three Grand Masters**
- All GMs score **90% or higher**
- At least **10 competitors** in the division

If eligible, match scores are automatically added to classification. If you score **95% or higher** at Nationals, you’ll be moved to **Grand Master** for that division.
